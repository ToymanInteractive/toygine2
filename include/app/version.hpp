  \struct Version
  \brief Application version information structure.

  Version represents a semantic version number following the major.minor.maintenance.revision format. This structure is
  designed for compile-time version management and provides a simple way to track application versions throughout the
  development lifecycle.

  \section features Key Features

  - ‚öôÔ∏è **Semantic Versioning**: Follows major.minor.maintenance.revision format
  - üîß **constexpr Support**: All operations can be evaluated at compile time
  - üõ°Ô∏è **Exception Safety**: All operations are noexcept
  - üîó **Simple Structure**: Plain struct with public members for easy access
  - üéØ **Version Management**: Designed for application version tracking
  - üß¨ **Type Safety**: Uses std::uint32_t for all version components
  - üåç **Standard Compliance**: Follows semantic versioning standards
  - üìè **Immutable Design**: Structure designed for compile-time version constants

  \section usage Usage Example

  \code
  #include "app.hpp"

  // Default version (0.0.0.0)
  constexpr toy::app::Version version;

  // Custom version
  constexpr toy::app::Version customVersion{1, 2, 3, 4};

  // Access version components
  std::cout << "Version: " << customVersion.major << "."
            << customVersion.minor << "."
            << customVersion.maintenance << "."
            << customVersion.revision << std::endl;
  \endcode

  \section performance Performance Characteristics

  - ‚öôÔ∏è **Construction**: O(1) constant time
  - üìù **Access**: O(1) constant time for all members
  - üìù **Assignment**: O(1) constant time for member assignment
  - üîó **Comparison**: O(1) constant time for version comparison
  - üíæ **Memory Usage**: 16 bytes (4 * std::uint32_t)
  - ‚ö° **Cache Performance**: Excellent due to small size and contiguous layout
  - üìã **Copy Performance**: Fast due to simple integer copying
  - üéØ **Version Operations**: Optimized for compile-time evaluation

  \section safety Safety Guarantees

  - üõ°Ô∏è **Bounds Safety**: All operations are bounds-safe
  - üìê **Type Safety**: Strong typing with std::uint32_t components
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Exception Safety**: All operations are noexcept, no exceptions thrown
  - üîí **Memory Safety**: No dynamic allocation, stack-only structure

  \section compatibility Compatibility

  - üåê **Cross-Platform**: Works on all platforms supported by the compiler
  - üîß **Embedded Systems**: Suitable for resource-constrained environments
  - üì± **Mobile Platforms**: Lightweight and efficient for mobile applications

  \note This structure is designed for compile-time version management. For runtime version parsing from strings,
        consider implementing additional utility functions.

  \brief Three-way comparison operator for two versions.

  Compares two versions using lexicographical ordering following semantic versioning principles. The comparison

  \param rhs The right-hand side version.
