  \class CStringView
  \brief Non-owning string view class for C-style strings.

  CStringView is a lightweight, non-owning wrapper around C-style strings that provides a safe and efficient way to work
  with null-terminated character arrays. It offers a std::string_view-like interface while being specifically designed
  for constexpr contexts and compile-time string manipulation.

  Unlike std::string_view, CStringView is optimized for constexpr usage and provides additional functionality for
  compile-time string operations. It does not own the underlying string data and simply holds a pointer to it, making
  it extremely lightweight and efficient.

  \section features Key Features

  - ‚öôÔ∏è **Zero Allocation**: No dynamic memory allocation, only holds a pointer
  - üîß **constexpr Support**: Most operations can be evaluated at compile time
  - üõ°Ô∏è **Exception Safety**: All operations are noexcept
  - üîó **STL Compatibility**: Provides std::string_view/std::string like interface
  - üåç **UTF-8 Support**: Built-in UTF-8 character counting and manipulation
  - üß¨ **Type Safety**: Uses C++20 concepts for type safety
  - üìè **Non-owning**: Does not manage memory, safe for temporary strings

  \section usage Usage Example

  \code
  #include "c_string_view.hpp"

  // Create a string view from a C string
  toy::CStringView str("Hello, World!");

  // Use in constexpr context
  constexpr auto greeting = toy::CStringView("Hello");
  constexpr auto world = toy::CStringView("World");
  constexpr auto combined = greeting + " " + world;

  // Safe string operations
  if (str.starts_with("Hello")) {
    // Process the string
  }
  \endcode

  \section performance Performance Characteristics

  - ‚öôÔ∏è **Construction**: O(1) - just stores a pointer
  - üìù **Assignment**: O(1) - just copies a pointer
  - üîç **Search Operations**: O(n*m) where n is the string length and m is the pattern length
  - üíæ **Memory Usage**: Minimal - only stores a single pointer
  - ‚ö° **Cache Performance**: Excellent due to pointer-only storage
  - üìã **Copy Performance**: Extremely fast - just pointer copy
  - üéØ **String Operations**: Optimized for common cases

  \section safety Safety Guarantees

  - üõ°Ô∏è **Contracts & Debug Checks**: Bounds are asserted in debug; in production, violating preconditions is UB
  - üîí **Null Pointer Safety**: All C-string operations validate pointers via assertions in debug
  - üìê **Type Safety**: Concepts prevent invalid usage
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Exception Safety**: All operations are noexcept, no exceptions thrown
  - ‚è∞ **Lifetime Safety**: User must ensure underlying string remains valid

  \section compatibility Compatibility

  - üÜï **C++23**: Requires C++23 or later for full functionality
  - üîó **STL Integration**: Compatible with STL algorithms and containers
  - üåê **Cross-Platform**: Works on all platforms supported by the compiler
  - üîß **Embedded Systems**: Suitable for resource-constrained environments

  \warning The underlying C string must remain valid for the lifetime of the CStringView object.
           CStringView does not own the string data and will not manage its lifetime.
