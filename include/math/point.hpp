  \class Point
  \brief 2D integer point class for UI and input handling.

  Point is a lightweight, high-performance 2D point class that uses integer coordinates. It is specifically designed for
  UI elements, mouse input handling, window positioning, and GUI layout calculations where pixel-perfect positioning is
  required.

  The coordinate type is configurable through the \a value_type alias, allowing for different integer precisions based
  on application needs (defaults to \a std::int32_t).

  \section features Key Features

  - ⚙️ **Configurable Precision**: Uses configurable integer type (currently std::int32_t) for pixel-perfect positioning
  - 🔧 **constexpr Support**: Most operations can be evaluated at compile time
  - 🛡️ **Exception Safety**: All operations are noexcept
  - 🔗 **STL Compatibility**: Provides standard container-like interface
  - 🎯 **UI Optimized**: Designed specifically for UI and input handling
  - 🧬 **Type Safety**: Strong typing with clear coordinate semantics

  \section usage Usage Example

  \code
  #include "math/point.hpp"

  // Mouse position handling
  toy::math::Point mousePos(100, 200);

  // Window positioning
  toy::math::Point windowPos(50, 75);

  // GUI element positioning
  toy::math::Point buttonPos(10, 10);
  buttonPos += Point(5, 5); // Move button

  // Use in constexpr context
  constexpr auto origin = toy::math::Point(0, 0);
  constexpr auto center = toy::math::Point(640, 480);
  \endcode

  \section performance Performance Characteristics

  - ⚙️ **Construction**: O(1) constant time
  - 📝 **Assignment**: O(1) constant time
  - 🔗 **Arithmetic Operations**: O(1) constant time
  - 🔍 **Comparison Operations**: O(1) constant time
  - 💾 **Memory Usage**: 2 * sizeof(value_type) bytes (currently 8 bytes with std::int32_t)
  - ⚡ **Cache Performance**: Excellent due to small size and stack allocation
  - 📋 **Copy Performance**: Fast due to simple integer copying
  - 🎯 **UI Operations**: Optimized for UI and input handling

  \section safety Safety Guarantees

  - 🛡️ **Contracts & Debug Checks**: Division by zero is asserted in debug
  - 🔒 **Bounds Safety**: All operations are bounds-safe
  - 📐 **Type Safety**: Strong typing prevents coordinate mixing
  - ⚠️ **Exception Safety**: All operations are noexcept, no exceptions thrown

  \section compatibility Compatibility

  - 🆕 **C++20**: Requires C++20 or later for full functionality
  - 🔗 **STL Integration**: Compatible with STL algorithms and containers
  - 🌐 **Cross-Platform**: Works on all platforms supported by the compiler
  - 🔧 **Embedded Systems**: Suitable for resource-constrained environments
  - 🔧 **Type Flexibility**: Coordinate type can be changed via \a value_type alias if needed

  \note This class is specifically designed for UI and input handling. For sprite positioning and world coordinates,
        consider using Vector2 with floating-point precision.
