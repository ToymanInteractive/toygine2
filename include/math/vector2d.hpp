  \class Vector2D
  \brief 2D floating-point vector class for interactive game objects and physics calculations.

  Vector2D represents a 2D vector with floating-point coordinates, designed for interactive game objects, sprite
  positioning, character movement, particle systems, physics calculations, and world coordinate transformations where
  sub-pixel precision is required.

  \section features Key Features

  - ‚öôÔ∏è **Floating-Point Precision**: Uses \a real_t (float) for sub-pixel positioning and smooth movement
  - üîß **constexpr Support**: Most operations can be evaluated at compile time
  - üõ°Ô∏è **Exception Safety**: All operations are noexcept
  - üéØ **Game Optimized**: Designed specifically for interactive game objects and physics
  - üß¨ **Type Safety**: Strong typing with clear vector semantics

  \section usage Usage Example

  \code
  #include "math/vector2d.hpp"

  // Sprite positioning
  toy::math::Vector2D spritePos(100.5f, 200.3f);

  // Character movement
  toy::math::Vector2D velocity(50.0f, -25.0f);
  spritePos += velocity * deltaTime;

  // Physics calculations
  toy::math::Vector2D force(10.0f, 0.0f);
  toy::math::Vector2D acceleration = force / mass;

  // Particle system
  std::vector<toy::math::Vector2D> particles;
  for (auto& particle : particles) {
      particle += velocity * deltaTime;
  }
  \endcode

  \section performance Performance Characteristics

  - ‚öôÔ∏è **Construction**: O(1) constant time
  - üìù **Assignment**: O(1) constant time
  - üîó **Arithmetic Operations**: O(1) constant time
  - ‚öñÔ∏è **Comparison Operations**: O(1) constant time
  - üíæ **Memory Usage**: 8 bytes (2 * sizeof(real_t))
  - ‚ö° **Cache Performance**: Excellent due to small size and stack allocation
  - üìã **Copy Performance**: Fast due to simple floating-point copying

  \section safety Safety Guarantees

  - üõ°Ô∏è **Contracts & Debug Checks**: Division by zero is asserted in debug
  - üîí **Bounds Safety**: All operations are bounds-safe
  - üìê **Type Safety**: Strong typing prevents coordinate mixing
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Exception Safety**: All operations are noexcept, no exceptions thrown

  \note This class is specifically designed for interactive game objects and physics calculations. For UI positioning
        and pixel-perfect coordinates, consider using Point with integer coordinates.
