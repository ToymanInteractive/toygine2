  \brief Debug assertion macro for runtime \a expression checking.

  This macro provides runtime assertion checking in debug builds. It evaluates the given \a expression and triggers an
  assertion failure if the \a expression is false. In release builds, this macro expands to nothing.

  \param expression The boolean expression to evaluate. Must be convertible to bool.

  \note This macro is only active in debug builds (_DEBUG defined).
  \note In release builds, this macro expands to ((void)0) and has no effect.
  \note Assertion failures will call toy::assertion::assertion with file, function, and line information.
  \note The \a expression is evaluated only once and should not have side effects.

  \warning Do not rely on the \a expression being evaluated in release builds.
  \warning The \a expression should not have side effects as it may not be evaluated in release builds.

  This macro provides runtime assertion checking in debug builds with a custom error \a message. It evaluates the given
  \a expression and triggers an assertion failure with the provided \a message if the \a expression is false. In release
  builds, this macro expands to nothing.

  \param expression The boolean expression to evaluate. Must be convertible to bool.
  \param message    A custom error message to display on assertion failure. Must be a C string literal.

  \note This macro is only active in debug builds (_DEBUG defined).
  \note In release builds, this macro expands to ((void)0) and has no effect.
  \note Assertion failures will call toy::assertion::assertion with file, function, line, and custom \a message.
  \note The \a expression is evaluated only once and should not have side effects.
  \note The \a message parameter is passed as-is to the assertion handler.

  \warning Do not rely on the \a expression being evaluated in release builds.
  \warning The \a expression should not have side effects as it may not be evaluated in release builds.
  \warning The \a message should be a C string literal for optimal performance.
